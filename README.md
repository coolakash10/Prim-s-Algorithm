# Prim-s-Algorithm
Algorithm use to find minimum spanning tree

Minimum spanning tree can be found by greedy approach Prim's Algorithm

Complexity

          1. Time Complexity : (ElogV)
          2. Space Complexity: (E+V)
          
At each stage we find minimum distance from each unvisited node & take minimum value present after visiting it in queue.
